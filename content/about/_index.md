Welcome to White Label Digital Twins (WLDT), an open-source project dedicated to supporting the design, development, and deployment of Digital Twins within the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems.

The WLDT library has been designed to align with the latest DT definitions from both Industrial and Scientific domains. It identifies DTs as active, flexible, and scalable software components. Our library aims to provide developers with the tools and resources necessary to create robust Digital Twins that effectively simulate and monitor physical assets within IoT environments.

Whether you're working on IoT, Industrial IoT (IIoT) applications, Smart Cities projects, or any other IoT-related endeavor, the WLDT library offers a versatile solution for implementing Digital Twins that accurately represent real-world objects and support informed decision-making processes.
